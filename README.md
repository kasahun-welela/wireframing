# wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a blueprint or skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the basic structure and layout without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the placement of elements, navigation flow, and overall user interface structure. <br />

<h2>Key Elements in a Wireframe</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Layout Structure:</strong> Defines the arrangement of elements on the page.</li>
  <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Shows how users will move through the site or application.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Placement:</strong> Indicates where text, images, and other content will be positioned.</li>
  <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> Outlines key functionalities and interactions.</li>
</ul>
